% EN: Not all design patterns are concerned with designing class hierarchies. For commonly occurring problems, a software design pattern is the most general and reusable solution, and, for those programming in C++, one of the most commonly occurring problems is inadequate performance. One of the most common causes of such poor performance is inefficient memory management. Patterns were developed to deal with these problems. In this chapter, we will explore one such pattern that addresses, in particular, the overhead of small, frequent memory allocations.

\section{The overhead of small memory allocations}

% EN: The local buffer optimization is just that - an optimization. It is a performance-oriented pattern, and we must, therefore, keep in mind the first rule of performance - never guess anything about performance. Performance, and the effect of any optimization, must be measured.

\subsection{The cost of memory allocations}

% EN: Since we are exploring the overhead of memory allocations and the ways to reduce it, the first question we must answer is how expensive a memory allocation is. After all, nobody wants to optimize something so fast that it needs no optimization. We can use Google Benchmark (or any other microbenchmark, if you prefer) to answer this question. The simplest benchmark to measure the cost of memory allocation might look like this:

% EN: Here, we make \texttt{N} calls to \texttt{malloc} before starting the benchmark. Further improvements can be achieved by varying the allocation size during the reallocations. We have also replicated the body of the benchmark loop \texttt{32} times (using the C preprocessor macro) to reduce the overhead of the loop itself on the measurement. The time reported by the benchmark is now the time it takes to do \texttt{32} allocations and deallocations, which is not very convenient, but the allocation rate remains valid, since we have accounted for the loop unrolling, and multiplied the number of iterations by \texttt{32} when setting the number of processed items (in Google Benchmark, an item is whatever you want it to be, and the number of items per second is reported at the end of the benchmark, so we have declared one allocation/deallocation to be an item).

As we are dealing with small allocations, it is highly likely that the processing time spent on each allocated memory fragment is also small, and the overhead of allocation is non-trivial. This, of course, represents guessing about performance and is something I warned you against, and so we will confirm this claim via direct experiments.

\section{Introducing local buffer optimization}

% EN: The least amount of work a program can do to accomplish a certain task is no work at all. Free stuff is great. Similarly, the fastest way to allocate and deallocate memory is this - don't. Local buffer optimization is a way to get something for nothing; in this case, to get some memory for no additional computing cost.

% EN: The string allocates its memory from \texttt{malloc()} via a \texttt{strdup()} call and returns it by calling \texttt{free()}. To be in any way useful, the string would need many more member functions, but these are sufficient for now to explore the overhead of memory allocation. Speaking of allocation, every time a string is constructed, copied, or assigned, an allocation happens. To be more precise, every time a string is constructed, an additional allocation happens; the string object itself has to be allocated somewhere, which may be on the stack for a local variable, or on the heap if the string is a part of some dynamically allocated data structure. In addition to that, an allocation for the string data happens, and the memory is always taken from \texttt{malloc()}.

Of course, a string can be arbitrarily long, so we do not know in advance how much larger we need to make the string object to store any string the program will encounter.

% EN: Why is that happening, if there are no allocations at all? This experiment shows the second, very important, benefit of local buffer optimization - improved cache locality. The string object itself has to be accessed before the string data can be read; it contains the pointer to the data. For the regular string, accessing the string characters involves two memory accesses at different, generally unrelated addresses. If the total amount of data is large, then the second access, to the string data, is likely to miss the cache and wait for the data to be brought from the main memory. On the other hand, the optimized string keeps the data close to the string object, so that once the string itself is in the cache, so is the data. The reason that we need a sufficient amount of different strings to see this benefit is that with few strings, all string objects and their data can reside in the cache permanently. Only when the total size of the strings exceeds the size of the cache will the performance benefits manifest themselves. Now, let's dive deeper into some additional optimizations.

We know exactly where the data is, in the local buffer. We do need to know, somehow, whether the data is in the local buffer or in the externally allocated memory, but we don't need to use 8 bytes (on a 64-bit machine) just to store that. Of course, we still need the pointer for storing longer strings, but we could reuse that memory for the buffer when the string is short:

Note that the total buffer size is still \texttt{16} characters, \texttt{15} for the string itself and \texttt{1} for the tag, which also doubles at the trailing zero if the string needs all \texttt{16} bytes (this is why we have to use \texttt{tag\ ==\ 0} to indicate local storage, as it would cost us an extra byte to do otherwise). The pointer is overlaid in memory with the first \texttt{8} bytes of the character buffer. In this example, we have chosen to optimize the total memory occupied by the string; this string still has a 16-character local buffer, just like the previous version, but the object itself is now only 16 bytes, not 24. If we were willing to keep the object size the same, we could have used a larger buffer and stored longer strings locally. The benefit of the small string optimization does, generally, diminish as the strings become longer. The optimal crossover point from local to remote strings depends on the particular application and must of course be determined by benchmark measurements.

\subsection{Small queue}

% EN: The small vector we have just seen uses a local buffer to store a small array of vector elements. This is the standard way of optimizing data structures that store a variable number of elements when this number is often small. A particular version of this optimization is used for data structures based on a queue, where the buffer grows on one end and is consumed on the other end. If there are only a few elements in the queue at any time, the queue can be optimized with a local buffer. The technique commonly employed here is a \textbf{circular buffer}: our buffer is an array of fixed size \texttt{buffer{[}N{]}}, so, as the elements are added to the end of the queue, we are going to reach the end of the array. By then some elements were taken from the queue, so the first few elements of the array are no longer used. When we reach the end of the array, the next enqueued value goes into the first element of the array, \texttt{buffer{[}0{]}}. The array is treated like a ring, after the element \texttt{buffer{[}N-1{]}} comes the element \texttt{buffer{[}0{]}} (hence another name for this technique, a \emph{ring buffer}).

\subsection{Type-erased and callable objects}

% EN: There is another, very different, type of application where the local buffer optimization can be used very effectively - storing callable objects, which are objects that can be invoked as functions. Many template classes provide an option to customize some part of their behavior using a callable object. For example, \texttt{std::shared\_ptr}, the standard shared pointer in C++, allows the user to specify a custom deleter. This deleter will be called with the address of the object to be deleted, so it is a callable with one argument of the \texttt{void*} type. It could be a function pointer, a member function pointer, or a functor object (an object with an \texttt{operator()} defined) - any type that can be called on a \texttt{p} pointer; that is, any type that compiles in the \texttt{callable(p)} function call syntax can be used. The deleter, however, is more than a type; it is an object and is specified at runtime, and so it needs to be stored someplace where the shared pointer can get to it. Were the deleter a part of the shared pointer type, we could simply declare a data member of that type in the shared pointer object (or, in the case of the C++ shared pointer, in its reference object that is shared between all copies of the shared pointer). You could consider it a trivial application of the local buffer optimization, as in the following smart pointer that automatically deletes the object when the pointer goes out of scope (just like \texttt{std::unique\_ptr}):

\Trans{We have seen the applications of local buffer optimization; for simplicity, we stayed with the most basic implementation of it. This simple implementation misses several important details, which we will now highlight.}{}

% EN: First of all, we completely neglected the alignment of the buffer. The type we used to reserve the space inside an object is \texttt{char}; therefore, our buffer is byte-aligned. Most data types have higher alignment requirements: the exact requirements are platform-specific, but most built-in types are aligned on their own size (double is 8-byte-aligned on a 64-bit platform such as x86). Higher alignments are needed for some machine-specific types such as packed integer or floating-point arrays for AVX instructions.

% EN: Alignment is important: depending on the processor and the code generated by the compiler, accessing memory not aligned as required by the data type can result in poor performance or memory access violations (crashes). For example, most AVX instructions require 16- or 32-byte alignment, and the unaligned versions of these instructions are significantly slower. Another example is atomic operations such as the ones used in mutexes and other concurrent data structures: they also don't work if the data type is not properly aligned (for example, an atomic \texttt{long} must be aligned on an 8-byte boundary).

In the previous section, we used an array of \texttt{int} for the small vector of integers. Again, there is a subtlety here: declaring the buffer as an object or an array of objects of the right type will cause these objects to be destroyed automatically when the object containing the buffer is destroyed. For trivially destructible types such as integers, it makes no difference at all -- their destructors do nothing.

% EN: In general, this is not so, and an arbitrary destructor can be invoked only if an object was constructed at this location. For our small vector, this is not always the case: the vector may be empty or contain fewer objects than the buffer can hold. This is the most common case by far: usually, if we employ local buffer optimization, we cannot be sure that an object was constructed in the buffer. In this case, declaring the buffer as an array of non-trivially-destructible objects would be a mistake. However, if you have a guarantee that, in your particular case, the buffer always contains an object (or several objects, for an array), declaring them with the corresponding type greatly simplifies the implementation of the destructor, as well as the copy/move operations.

% EN: You should have noticed by now that a typical implementation of a local buffer needs a lot of boilerplate code.

As is the case for any design pattern, our exploration is not complete without mentioning the trade-offs and the downsides.

\section{Downsides of local buffer optimization}

% EN: Local buffer optimization is not without its downsides. The most obvious one is that all objects with a local buffer are larger than they would be without one. If the typical data stored in the buffer is smaller than the chosen buffer size, then every object is wasting some memory, but at least the optimization is paying off. Worse, if our choice of buffer size is badly off and most data is, in fact, larger than the local buffer, the data is stored remotely but the local buffers are still created inside every object, and all that memory is wasted.

% EN: There is an obvious trade-off between the amount of memory we are willing to waste and the range of data sizes where the optimization is effective. The size of the local buffer should be carefully chosen with the application in mind.

% EN: The more subtle complication is this - the data that used to be external to the object is now stored inside the object. This has several consequences, in addition to the performance benefits we were so focused on. First of all, every copy of the object contains its own copy of the data as long as it fits into the local buffer. This prevents designs such as the reference counting of data; for example, a \textbf{Copy-On-Write} (\textbf{COW}) string, where the data is not copied as long as all string copies remain the same, cannot use the small string optimization.

% EN: Secondly, the data must be moved if the object itself is moved. Contrast this with \texttt{std::vector}, which is moved or swapped, essentially like a pointer - the pointer to the data is moved but the data remains in place. A similar consideration exists for the object contained inside \texttt{std::any}. You could dismiss this concern as trivial; after all, local buffer optimization is used primarily for small amounts of data, and the cost of moving them should be comparable to the cost of copying the pointer. However, more than performance is at stake here - moving an instance of \texttt{std::vector} (or \texttt{std::any}, for that matter) is guaranteed not to throw an exception. However, no such guarantees are offered when moving an arbitrary object. Therefore, \texttt{std::any} can be implemented with a local buffer optimization only if the object it contains is \texttt{std::is\_nothrow\_move\_constructible}.

% EN: Even such a guarantee does not suffice for the case of \texttt{std::vector}, however; the standard explicitly states that moving, or swapping, a vector does not invalidate iterators pointing to any element of the vector. Obviously, this requirement is incompatible with local buffer optimization, since moving a small vector would relocate all its elements to a different region of memory. For that reason, many high-efficiency libraries offer a custom vector-like container that supports small vector optimization, at the expense of the standard iterator invalidation guarantees.

\section{Summary}

% EN: We have just introduced a design pattern aimed solely at improved performance. Efficiency is an important consideration for the C++ language; thus, the C++ community developed patterns to address the most common inefficiencies. Repeated or wasteful memory allocation is perhaps the most common of all. The design pattern we have just seen - local buffer optimization - is a powerful tool that can greatly reduce such allocations. We have seen how it can be applied to compact data structures, as well as to store small objects, such as callables. We have also reviewed the possible downsides of using this pattern.
